/**
 * Soft Delete Plugin for Kysera ORM
 *
 * This plugin implements soft delete functionality using the Method Override pattern:
 * - Automatically filters out soft-deleted records from SELECT queries
 * - Adds softDelete(), restore(), and hardDelete() methods to repositories
 * - Provides findWithDeleted() and findDeleted() utility methods
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { softDeletePlugin } from '@kysera/soft-delete'
 * import { createORM } from '@kysera/repository'
 *
 * const orm = await createORM(db, [
 *   softDeletePlugin({
 *     deletedAtColumn: 'deleted_at',
 *     tables: ['users', 'posts']
 *   })
 * ])
 *
 * const userRepo = orm.createRepository(createUserRepository)
 *
 * // Soft delete a user (sets deleted_at)
 * await userRepo.softDelete(1)
 *
 * // Find all users (excludes soft-deleted)
 * await userRepo.findAll()
 *
 * // Find including deleted
 * await userRepo.findAllWithDeleted()
 *
 * // Restore a soft-deleted user
 * await userRepo.restore(1)
 *
 * // Permanently delete (real DELETE)
 * await userRepo.hardDelete(1)
 * ```
 *
 * ## Architecture Note
 *
 * This plugin uses Method Override, not full query interception:
 * - ✅ SELECT queries are automatically filtered
 * - ❌ DELETE queries are NOT automatically converted to soft deletes
 * - Use softDelete() method explicitly instead of delete()
 *
 * This design is intentional for simplicity and explicitness.
 *
 * @param options - Configuration options for soft delete behavior
 * @returns Plugin instance that can be used with createORM
