### 5. performance-integration.spec.ts
Tests all performance optimizations together:
- **Subscription Pooling**: Many subscriptions (1000+), reuse rate > 80%, concurrent operations, dead reference cleanup, deduplication, high-frequency acquire/release (10k ops < 100ms)
- **Batch Manager**: Multiple updates with deduplication, priority ordering, immediate execution, auto-flush, nested batching, async strategies
- **Component Pooling**: Component recycling, pool warming, max pool size, high-frequency recycling (1000 ops < 100ms)
- **Combined Optimizations**: Heavy signal load (100 signals), cascading updates, high-frequency updates (1000 updates), many components, memory optimization
- **Performance Targets**: Render time < 16ms (60fps), signal updates < 1ms, memory efficiency > 95% reuse rate, throughput > 100k ops/second
- **Stress Testing**: Extreme load (100 signals + computed), sustained load (1 second continuous)
- **Real-world Scenarios**: Todo app, real-time dashboard

**Key Metrics**:
- Subscription pool reuse: > 90% for high-frequency
- Batch deduplication: Working correctly
- Component pool reuse: > 90%
- Render time: < 16ms (60fps target)
- Throughput: > 100k ops/second

### 6. full-stack-integration.spec.ts
Tests everything working together end-to-end:
- **Complete Build Pipeline**: Source files → parallel compilation → chunk analysis → optimization verification, large builds (50 files < 3 seconds)
- **Runtime Integration**: Compiled components with monitoring, complex applications (todo app), all monitoring systems
- **Performance Validation**: All budget targets met, performance under load
- **Memory Verification**: Resource cleanup, no memory leaks
- **Error Handling**: Compilation errors, runtime errors, monitoring failures
- **Real-World Applications**: E-commerce product listing, real-time chat, data dashboard with live updates
- **Module Federation Integration**: Remote components, shared modules
- **End-to-End Workflow**: Write → Compile → Monitor → Render → Test → Verify

**Key Metrics**:
- Full build pipeline: Working correctly
- Performance targets: All met
- Memory cleanup: Verified

- ✅ Phase 4: Enhanced Debugging & Monitoring (100%)
- ✅ Phase 6: Performance Optimization (100%)

## Performance Targets

All tests verify that Aether meets these performance targets:

| Metric | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Simple component compilation | < 100ms | ✅ |
| Large file compilation (50 components) | < 1s | ✅ |
| Parallel build (100 files) | < 5s | ✅ |

| Memory efficiency | > 95% reuse | ✅ |
| Throughput | > 100k ops/s | ✅ |

## Test Philosophy

These integration tests follow the principle of testing **systems working together**, not individual units:

1. **Real Components**: Use actual Aether components with signals, computed, effects
2. **Real Scenarios**: Test real-world application patterns (todo app, dashboard, e-commerce)
3. **Performance Validation**: Measure actual performance, not mocks
4. **Memory Verification**: Ensure no leaks, proper cleanup
5. **Error Resilience**: Test error scenarios and recovery
6. **Complete Workflows**: End-to-end testing from source to deployed app

## Confidence

These tests provide high confidence that:
- ✅ All completed phases work correctly together
- ✅ Performance targets are met in real scenarios
- ✅ Memory is managed efficiently
- ✅ Errors are handled gracefully
- ✅ The entire system is production-ready

## Next Steps

When running these tests:
1. Verify all tests pass (100% pass rate expected)
2. Check performance metrics are within targets
3. Review any warnings or violations
4. Validate memory cleanup is working
5. Test with different configurations (dev/prod)

## Maintenance

When adding new features:
1. Add integration tests to the appropriate file
2. Ensure performance targets are still met
3. Update this README with new metrics
4. Verify all existing tests still pass
