## 🎯 Recent Updates (2025-01-27)

### Project Renamed to Orchestron
- Renamed from `aletheia-csp` to **Orchestron**
- Updated all references, classes, and CLI commands
- Better reflects the comprehensive orchestration nature of the system

### Netron HTTP Transport Integration (In Progress)
- Created `NetronHttpModule` to replace Fastify-based implementation
- Integrated with Titan's Netron transport layer
- Provides native HTTP server using Netron's HTTP transport
- Benefits:
  - Better integration with Titan framework
  - Native support for service exposure via HTTP
  - Reduced external dependencies

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

1. **Complete Netron HTTP Integration**
   - Fix remaining TypeScript compilation errors
   - Test HTTP server functionality
   - Ensure dashboard works with new transport

2. **Test Phase 9 Implementation**
   ```bash
   cd apps/orchestron
   yarn test test/core/phase9-integration.test.ts
   ```

3. **Begin Phase 10: Agent Collaboration**
   - Design inter-agent communication bus using Netron
   - Implement task distribution algorithms
   - Create knowledge consensus mechanisms
   - Build load balancing strategies

4. **Performance Optimization**
