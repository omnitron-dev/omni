2. **Performance-obsessed**: Every feature measured against benchmarks
3. **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript implementation
4. **Amazing DX**: Focus on debugging and testing tools
5. **Composition over configuration**: Modular architecture
6. **Explicit over implicit**: Clear APIs, no magic
7. **Conventions that scale**: Consistent patterns throughout
8. **Utilities over abstractions**: Practical helper functions
9. **Control flow clarity**: Predictable execution
10. **Full-stack coherence**: Unified mental model
11. **Dependency injection optional**: Works without DI
12. **Modules optional**: Core usable standalone
13. **Self-contained SSR**: No external dependencies
14. **Built to evolve**: Extensible architecture

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to completing the Aether framework while maintaining its core philosophy of simplicity, performance, and developer experience. The phased approach allows for incremental delivery of value while ensuring quality and maintaining backward compatibility.

The plan prioritizes compiler and build system enhancements as these provide the most immediate value to developers through improved performance and smaller bundle sizes. Testing and debugging improvements follow to ensure a robust development experience.

Success will be measured through both quantitative metrics (performance, bundle size) and qualitative feedback from the developer community. Regular reviews and adjustments will ensure the plan remains aligned with project goals and user needs.
