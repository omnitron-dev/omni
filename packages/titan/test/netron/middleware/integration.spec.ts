 * Integration tests for Netron Middleware with Transports

 * Note: Middleware integration with transports is covered by:
 * - test/netron/integration/full-auth-flow.spec.ts (WebSocket + Auth middleware)
 * - test/netron/transport/http/*.spec.ts (HTTP transport tests)
 * - test/netron/middleware/*.spec.ts (Middleware unit tests)
 *
 * This file kept as placeholder for future cross-transport integration tests.
