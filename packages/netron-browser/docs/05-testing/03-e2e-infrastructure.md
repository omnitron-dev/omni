# Netron Browser E2E Test Infrastructure - Complete Guide

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the E2E test infrastructure created for validating browser-server compatibility between Netron Browser and Titan Netron.

## 📁 Files Created

### Test Services (`tests/fixtures/test-services.ts`)
Complete service implementations for testing:
- **CalculatorService**: Basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- **UserService**: CRUD operations for user management
- **EchoService**: Data type validation (strings, numbers, objects, arrays)
- **StreamService**: Array generation for future streaming tests

### Titan Server Fixture (`tests/fixtures/titan-server.ts`)
Utilities for creating test servers:
- `createTitanServer()` - Creates Titan server with Netron
- `getAvailablePort()` - Finds available ports for testing
- Configurable HTTP and WebSocket transports
- Automatic port allocation
- Cleanup utilities

### Browser Test Page (`tests/fixtures/test-app.html`)
Interactive HTML test page with:
- Connection controls (HTTP/WebSocket transport selection)
- Service test buttons for all test services
- Real-time output logging
- Performance testing controls
- Clean, modern UI with status indicators

### Browser Client Script (`tests/fixtures/test-client.ts`)
TypeScript client that runs in browser:
- Connection management
- Service method invocation
- Performance testing
- Error handling
- Window API exposure for Playwright

### Build Script (`tests/fixtures/build.ts`)
Build utilities for test infrastructure:
- `buildTestClient()` - Bundles test-client.ts for browser
- `startTestServer()` - Starts Titan server
- `buildAndServe()` - Combined build and serve

### Serve Script (`tests/fixtures/serve.ts`)
Static file server for E2E tests:
- Serves test-app.html
- Serves bundled client code
- Integrates with Titan server
- Graceful shutdown handling

### Playwright E2E Tests (`tests/e2e/browser-server.spec.ts`)
Comprehensive browser-based tests:

**HTTP Client Tests:**
- Connection management
- Calculator operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- User operations (list, get, create, update, delete)
- Echo operations (all data types)
- Performance tests (sequential, parallel)
- Error handling

**WebSocket Client Tests:**
- Connection management
- Service operations
- Reconnection handling

**Error Handling Tests:**
- Connection failures
- Button state management
- Invalid server connections

### Integration Tests (`tests/integration/client-server.test.ts`)
Node.js-based integration tests (faster than E2E):

**HTTP Client Integration:**
- All service operations
- Error handling
- Performance benchmarks
- Metrics validation

**WebSocket Client Integration:**
- Service operations
- Connection state
- Metrics

**Mixed Transport Tests:**
- Same results from both transports
- Concurrent operations

### Test Documentation (`tests/README.md`)

- Test structure overview
- Test types (unit, integration, E2E)
- Running instructions
- Debugging guide
- CI/CD integration

## 🚀 How to Run Tests

### Install Dependencies

First, ensure all dependencies are installed:

```bash
# From repo root
yarn install

# From netron-browser package
cd packages/netron-browser
```

### Run All Tests

```bash
npm run test:all
```

This runs:
1. Unit tests (existing)
2. Integration tests (new)
3. E2E tests with Playwright (new)

### Run Specific Test Types

```bash
# Unit tests only
npm run test:unit

# Integration tests only
npm run test:integration

# E2E tests only
npm run test:e2e

# E2E with UI
npm run test:e2e:ui

# E2E debug mode
npm run test:e2e:debug
```

### Manual Testing

```bash
# Start the test server
npm run test:e2e:serve

# Then open in browser:
# http://localhost:3000
```

This gives you an interactive test page to manually test all operations.

## 🎓 Learning Resources

### Understanding the Architecture

1. **Test Services** (`test-services.ts`) - Start here to see what services are available
2. **Titan Server Fixture** (`titan-server.ts`) - Learn how to create test servers
3. **Integration Tests** (`client-server.test.ts`) - See how to test in Node.js
4. **E2E Tests** (`browser-server.spec.ts`) - See how to test in browser
5. **Test Page** (`test-app.html`) - Interactive manual testing

### Best Practices

1. **Use Integration Tests for Speed**: They're faster than E2E tests
2. **Use E2E Tests for Browser-Specific Issues**: When you need real browser behavior
3. **Use Manual Test Page for Debugging**: Interactive testing is invaluable
4. **Clean Up Resources**: Always use `afterAll` to cleanup servers
5. **Test Both Success and Failure**: Include error scenarios

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add streaming tests (when streaming is implemented)
- [ ] Add authentication/authorization tests
- [ ] Add compression tests
- [ ] Add connection pooling tests
- [ ] Add stress/load tests
- [ ] Add visual regression tests
- [ ] Add mobile browser tests

## ✅ Verification

To verify the infrastructure is working:

```bash
# 1. Build the package
npm run build

# 2. Run unit tests (should pass existing tests)
npm run test:unit

# 3. Run integration tests (should pass all 45 tests)
npm run test:integration

# 4. Run E2E tests (should pass all ~20 tests in 3 browsers)
npm run test:e2e

# 5. Manual verification
npm run test:e2e:serve
# Open http://localhost:3000 and test manually
```

## 📞 Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the test output for specific error messages
2. Review `tests/README.md` for detailed documentation
3. Try manual testing with `npm run test:e2e:serve`
4. Check Playwright traces and screenshots in `playwright-report/`
5. Use debug mode: `npm run test:e2e:debug`

## 🎉 Summary

You now have:
- ✅ Complete E2E test infrastructure
